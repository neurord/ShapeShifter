## Description

Shape Shifter is a morphology converter which takes in Genesis (.p) files of neurons and condenses the morphology in multiple ways. The morphology can be condensed by reducing all compartatments with the same radius and under a specified value of lambda through either AC or DC methods. In addition, the final option is to condense as much compartments as possible to preserve electrontic length and size. Morphology files can be attained through http://neuromorpho.org/ and these .swc files on NeuroMorpho can be converted to .p files using cvapp (http://neuron.duke.edu/cells/usage.html). Previous trials of this program has resulted in reduction of the orginal file by almost 90%.
